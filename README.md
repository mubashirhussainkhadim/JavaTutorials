## First Program 

###### Write a program to accept name and total marks of N number of students in two single subscript arrays name[ ] and totalmarks[ ].
Calculate and print:
(i) The average of the total marks obtained by N number of students.
[average = (sum of total marks of all the students)/N]
(ii) Deviation of each student's total marks with the average.
[deviation = total marks of a student - average]

## Data Types 
###### Data types are divided into two groups:
Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char
 Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes (you will learn more about these in a later chapter)
